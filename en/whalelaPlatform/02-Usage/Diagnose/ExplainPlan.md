## ExplainPlan

**Implementation plan**

Explain Plan (execution plan) is used to explain the execution method and optimization strategy of query statements. By analyzing the execution plan, administrators can understand the execution of the query, discover potential performance bottlenecks, and optimize it. You can optimize query statements, create appropriate indexes, or adjust the storage structure of the collection based on the execution plan to improve query efficiency and overall performance.
