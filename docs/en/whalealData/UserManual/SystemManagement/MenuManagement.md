#### Menu Management

Clicking on "Menu Management" under the "System Management" menu allows administrators to manage the menus within the platform. This page is visible only to administrator users. On this page, you can view information about all the menus, as well as perform actions such as searching, adding, modifying, and deleting menus.

##### Search

The green button at the top is the search button. On the left side, there are two criteria fields. Fill in the filtering criteria in these fields, and then click "Search" to filter the desired menus.

##### Add

The blue button is the "Add" button. Clicking it will bring up a form, as shown in the image below. In this form, you can customize the menu type, menu icon, external link menu, menu visibility, menu title, route address, menu sorting, parent directory, and more. Once you've configured the menu, click "Confirm" to save it.

##### Delete

The delete button for menus is not available, likely to prevent accidental deletion. Instead, menus can be hidden based on requirements.
